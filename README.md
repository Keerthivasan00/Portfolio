# Personal Portfolio

My Personal Portfolio Website is a responsive and modern web application developed using React.js. The main purpose of this project is to showcase my technical skills, personal projects, educational background, and provide a quick way for potential employers or collaborators to learn more about me.

This portfolio serves as a digital resume and professional profile. It includes features such as:

A dedicated section to view my skills and the technologies I specialize in.

A project showcase area where each project is presented with a title, description, tech stack used, and optionally, a live demo or GitHub link.

A resume download button that allows visitors to download my resume in PDF format with one click.

A responsive design that ensures a smooth user experience across devices of all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Clean navigation and smooth scrolling to improve user experience.

This project helped me practice and strengthen my React development skills, especially in creating reusable components, managing routes, and structuring projects in a modular and scalable way.
